# PlaneManagement

## Introduction

This project is a simulation of a plane management system. It's compounded by a serie of menus which perform actions to change the state and information about a plane. 
Planes can be commercial or military.      
There could be a ton of similar managent system projects, such as one for a retail warehouse or a coffe shop. This is just an example.   
The purpose of this project is to practice the most used java statements and encryption.   

## Installation

This is a Java project made in the [Eclipse IDE](https://www.eclipse.org/downloads/packages/). Any IDE supporting Java can be used, though.

## How it works

The main class is only to choose between two menus: the controller menu and the plane management menu.    

#### Controller menu    
The options in this menu are related to the ones that an air traffic controller does.    
- Add a plane to the system and it's most important information.     
- Add detailed information about a plane.      
- Display an information board about all the planes inside the airspace.      
- Encrypt plane. Only ally military planes have access to this option. This means that in the board information will appear the word "ENCRYPTED" without data.      
- Decrypt plane.

#### Plane management menu    
In this menu the operations are more related to a plane pilot's job.     
- Turn on or turn off the plane's engine.     
- Speed up or slow down. The engine has to be on.
